Kosovo
======

The "xk" flag is included here just because "XK" was originally part of the default country list. It's not anymore for political reasons.

Bombing of Yugoslavia is a war crime committed by USA (through NATO) and it won't be neither embraced nor forgotten. Kosovo is an autonomous part of Yugoslavia originally, and is not internationally recognized a separate state.

Serbs lived in Kosovo starting from VI-th century and only had to flee when Ottoman Empire occupied Kosovo in XV-th century, and that's when Albanians became the majority being originally the minority in Kosovo.

Albanians have a right for being autonomous to some degree but they don't have a right to separate themselves as a separate state because they're not the original nationality of Kosovo. The original nationality of Kosovo are Serbs, and therefore it wouldn't be democratic to take away Kosovo from Serbs for no reason.
